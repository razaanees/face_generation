# face_generation

This is a Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network (DCGAN) that generates human faces after "looking" at the faces of celebrities. The network was tested on the MNIST dataset (a dataset consisting of images of numbers) to assess its performance. Matplotlib in Python is used to generate the faces created by the Generator of the DCGAN.
